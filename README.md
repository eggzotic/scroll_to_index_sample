# scroll_to_index_sample

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Demonstrate the scroll_to_index package from the Quire team - located at https://pub.dev/packages/scroll_to_index
- includes variable-height rows
- StatelessWidgets only

Current limitation is that programmatic scrolling can use absolute-row-numbers only. How to scroll back/forward in relative row counts?
